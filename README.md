# How project was done

- Project was done using KMP.
- It's using Koin for dependency injection.
- It's using SKIE to wrap the ViewModel for IOS.
- It's using Navigation to navigate between screens
- It's using a Serialization plugin to handle data classes.
- It's using Coroutines to handle asyncronous work.
- A MVVM pattern was the architectural choice.
- 

# Future impovements
- Handle cache data for images or even use the Database to prevent calling API network multiple times
